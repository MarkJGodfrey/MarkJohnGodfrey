            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Mark John Godfrey. I'm an aspiring web developer with a background in mathematics, and years of experience in programming.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From 2017 to 2020 I studied mathematics at The University of Newcastle upon Tyne. While I'd had some previous exposure to programming,
                 it was during my time at university that I really discovered my passion and aptitude for it. 
                 There's something I find incredibly compelling about the process of formulating real-world problems as one a computer can solve.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I've always considered myself to be quite creative, and I often feel an urge to make. Having grown up, and spent much of my free time building Lego,
                 I frequently find myself looking at the scenery around me and thinking up ways that you might recreate it with Lego.
                This inclination to recreate doesn't just apply to Lego. I find that I tend to enjoy any task that involves meeting exact aesthetic specifications,
                which is part of the reason I feel drawn to web development.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>My creative whims have been the catalyst for many of the programming <a href="projects.html">projects</a> that I've worked on since graduating from university.</p>
